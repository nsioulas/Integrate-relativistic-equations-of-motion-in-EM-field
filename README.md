# Integrate-relativistic-equations-of-motion-in-EM-field
Integrate the relativistic equtions of motion for charged particles in an EM field. Four different integration schemes are available, namely: Boris, Vay, HC , Lapenta_Markidis. The code has been parallelized using OPEN-MP

# Work needed to be done:

  - Function to interpolate values of fields at the location of the particle
